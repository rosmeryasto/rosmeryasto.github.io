excerpt: <p style='text-align: justify;'> 'This paper is the outcome of a teamwork for the course Econometrics 1 in which the mincer hypothesis is evaluated for several regions of Peru, so we focus on the region of Cajamarca. The data used in the econometric estimations were collected from the 2018 ENAHO. Among the main results is that the Mincer equation is validated, as both education and experience have a positive impact on wage determination. In addition, the presence of a wage gap with respect to gender and place of residence (urban-rural) is confirmed, since men have an additional income of 38% over women's income and there is an increase in salary of 62.3% only for belonging to the urban area.'
