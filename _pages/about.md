<p style='text-align: justify;'> I am a 9th semester economics student at the Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru. I am interested in issues of development and evaluation of public policies related to education. I love learning new things, whether they are related to my professional or personal development. My favorite hobbies include music, drawing and, of course, spending time with my family and friends.
