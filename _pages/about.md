<p style='text-align: justify;'> I am a 9th semester economics student at the Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru. I am interested in issues of development and evaluation of public policies related to education. I love learning new things, whether they are related to my professional or personal development. My favorite hobbies include music, drawing and, of course, spending time with my family and friends.

**VOLUNTEERING**

<p style='text-align: justify;'> In 2020, I participated as a digital volunteer in the campaign "Por ellas y ellos, por la educación de los niños del Perú" of the NGO Crea+ Perú, which aimed to donate tablets for low-income children with the purpose of giving them access to virtual education due to the covid 19 pandemic.
